## Prelude

My writings are written for my Children born since 2000.

Only there purity can cleanse the Earth from the immorality of there forefathers. Saving mankind from destruction.

> Keep your children pure or you and your children will be cleansed from this Earth.

## Fleshly Me

Men have no "Equal Rights"!

> That's my child also; "I told a half dozen, or more 'Birthing Humans"!
>
> That if they even thought about aborting my child.
>
> > I would come for them and everyone they knew!
>
> > > As My eyes burned with Fire, they all knew, "I was true"!

That's my kid also! And if your such a useless Animal to think other wise, your a Demon on Earth!

But Men get booked if of the woman has the child and it's theres, then you make there life, "hell", because your a slut useless Animal, when this was your choice = Hook up App piece of trash!

Take responsibility for your own decisions and actions!

For as you profess your selves before Men, so ye Have judged yourself before God.

So you Animals want it both ways, how evil you are, liers, and deniers of any truths!!!

## A Mans Rights

Do men have rights in abortion? The Greek view.

Abstract

Taken from : Pub Med GOV üîó [A Man's Rights in Abortion](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22457999/)

Aim: We have examined from a legal perspective the father's role in the decision to abort a pregnancy in western society.

Furthermore, we have taken a closer look into the inadequacies the Greek legal framework on this issue, from a legal and social point of view.

Methods: Literature in the Greek and English language.

Results: One of abortion's many victims is the father of the child.

In most European countries and the United States of America, the law does not give any rights to the father on the issue of an abortion.

Quite simply, men have no legal rights when it comes to abortion. Legally, an abortion is a private matter between a woman and her doctor, even if she is married. Greece was one of the last countries in Europe to legalize abortion after a long debate in Parliament and the publication of numerous declarations by women's rights organizations. However, despite the liberalization of abortion, which followed the ratification of L 1609/86, the legal framework in which abortions are carried out is not entirely satisfactory. One of the areas that require clarification is the role of father. L 1609/86 does not specify men's rights in abortion. Post-abortion counseling services are dealing with an increasing number of men coming forward, grieving their aborted children.

## Abortion

Abortion is Murder and the worst kind, that will send, "All of You", to the darkest depths of your own devised hell.

> No re-birth on this earth.
>
> > No Heaven just Hell will be your course, for eternity!
>
> > No connection to God or the Trinity, just Devil worshiping fleshly animals, "Non-Human Beasts", is all you will be the rest of your lives, and un-worthy to breed.

## Conception

> The moment the sperm penetrates the egg is conception and life!
>
> > This child now has a soul and a connection to the Trinity!

> A separate life from yours!

You made the decision of creation, weather intentional or haphazardly.

> And if conceived out of Wed Lock! Your are just fleshly Devilish worshiping Animals, ask any Hollywood Actress they will tell you there just Animals with No Humanity, condoning worshiping the flesh.

You should be sterilized and separated from the rest of, "US", that seek Father Gods truth's in purity and marriage.

## Immorality

See Page: üîó [Virtue on Sexual Matters](https://publiuslogic.com/blog/virtue)

### Dating and Marriage

Universal truths that are sill employed in many society's on Earth despite the Catholic Church wish to drive all to immorality for the churches worth.

If you are immoral the church gives you forgiveness for financial means. If you are pure and true of heart you do not need the church as you already follow Gods Laws and your own truths within the Holy Spirit.

Living in purity is the only way you can be one with the Holy Spirit to be 100% in Spirit and Flesh, with love and truth in your hearts, with nothing in your minds of immortality.

> Not even the knowledge of fleshly desire and how others participate in there desires.
>
> > These thing's of love and oneness are between Man and his Wife, and are, "Only", to be experienced by two of purity after they are bound together in Gods Name.

> Only knowing of each other, "Man and Wife", and your oneness of love in Gods Name.

## Quran Hadith

### Qur'an prophetic traditions (hadith)

For readers today, the Qur'an bears the stamp of its time and place, yet for many its message transcends time and history to express universal truths.

An English version of the first ten verses of the ninety-first chapter,

## The Sun

> Consider the sun and its radiance, and the moon reflecting the sun.

> Consider the day as it reveals the world,
> and the night that veils it in darkness.

> Consider the sky and its wonderful composition,
> the earth and its expanse.

> Consider the human self and He Who perfected it
> And how He imbued it with awareness of what is right and wrong.
> The one who helps this self to grow in a clean way attains to happiness.
> The one who buries it in darkness is really lost

## Sariah Law

Within Islamic discourse, ≈°arƒ´ øah refers to religious regulations governing the lives of Muslims.

For many Muslims, the word means simply "justice," and they will consider any law that promotes justice and social welfare to conform to Sharia.

According to the traditional Muslim view, the major precepts of Sharia were passed down directly from the Islamic prophet Muhammad without "historical development ", to guide it's precepts.

This historical development was lost intentionally for immoral and illicit sex with Minors.

So the Muslims go off course along with the Jews, and Christians where illicit sex and immorality are part of there socialites way of denying God and there bond with the Holy Spirit.

## Gods Ancient Laws

Humans 10s of thousands of years ago, through logic and discourse determined that the human body is a Temple of the Holy Sprit.

## 1 Corinthians 5:1 - 5:13

Context Summary

Sexual Immorality Defiles the Church.

First Corinthians 5:1‚Äì8 contains Paul's primary example of how the Corinthian's pride and self-sufficiency is hurting their community.

He has just asked if they would prefer he come in gentleness, or, "with a rod", symbolic of harsh judgment.

Here, Paul details a grievous sin: the believers in Corinth have failed to rebuke a member who is committing incest with his father's wife. They must remove him from the church and turn him over to Satan in hopes of his ultimate salvation.

This is also crucial for the health of the church just as tiny bits of leaven eventually spread to an entire batch of dough, sin left un-confronted can poison an entire church.
