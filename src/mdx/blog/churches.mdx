Pastor Robert Whalen gave a brilliant Sermon on, "Why":question:

Why does Father God let Evil into our world and not protect us from it. He made references to the Book Of Enoch on how Enoch's Was one of Father God's favorite, blessed with truth and happiness.

Enoch was tortured by Devil and Ok'ed by Father having everything in his life taken from him.

Enoch never directly denied God. :godmode:

One thing Pastor Whalen did not mention was Enoch's denial of self, Which is a denial of Father God.

> Never deny yourself My Loves, just learn and grow to know.
