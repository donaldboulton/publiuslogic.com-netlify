## Churches

In the 1990's I traveled all over the USA going to Hundreds of different Churches investigating what was true or not about there worship of Father God.

Just now reinvestigating the Church Life.

Pastor Robert Whalen gave a brilliant Sermon on, "Why"? 

Why does Father God let Evil into our world and not protect us from it. He made references to the Book Of Enoch on how Enoch's Was one of Father God's favorite, blessed with truth and happiness.

Enoch through the Devil and Ok'ed by Father was tortured having everything in his life taken from him.

Enoch never directly denied God.

One thing Pastor Whalen did not mention was Enoch's denial of self, Which is a denial of Father God.

> Never deny yourself My Loves, just learn and grow to know.

> > OKC with some help from you a new church every week. Need to see what all my children are doing. Not just at one venue.
