Portlanders are forming long lines to buy psychedelic mushrooms at a store in the city, despite recreational mushroom sales still being [illegal in Oregon](https://www.foxbusiness.com/category/fox-news-oregon).

## Psilocybin mushroom

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

"Magic mushroom"

`Psilocybe semilanceata`

Psilocybin mushrooms, commonly known as magic mushrooms, are a polyphyletic informal group of fungi that contain psilocybin which turns into psilocin upon ingestion.[1][2] Biological genera containing psilocybin mushrooms include Copelandia, Gymnopilus, Inocybe, Panaeolus, Pholiotina, Pluteus, and Psilocybe. 

Psilocybin mushrooms have been and continue to be used in indigenous New World cultures in religious, divinatory, or spiritual contexts. 

Psilocybin mushrooms are also used as recreational drugs. 

They may be depicted in Stone Age rock art in Africa and Europe, but are most famously represented in the Pre-Columbian sculptures and glyphs seen throughout North, Central and South America.
