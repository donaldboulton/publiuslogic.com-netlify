Donald Boulton and this üîó [publiuslogic.com](https://publiuslogic.com) üó∏ Website is a Affiliate for Google AdSense.

What this means for you:

- I became an affiliate to earn revenue towards the costs of running and maintaining this website. Where I have direct control over which ads are served on this website I offer only products that are directly related to the topic of this website and products that a reader/subscriber would have a genuine interest in or need of.
- I do not and will not recommend a product just for the sake of making money.
- I do not let the compensation I receive influence the content, topics, posts, or opinions expressed on this website.
- I respect and value my readers too much to write anything other than my own genuine and objective opinions and advice.

Just like this website, my Disclosure Policy is a work in progress. As the revenue streams evolve, so will this page.
