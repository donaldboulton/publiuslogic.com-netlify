## Chinese and Mexican Sleeper Agents

A sleeper agent, also called sleeper cell, is a spy who is placed in a target country or organization not to undertake an immediate mission but to act as a potential asset if activated. 

Even if un-activated, the "sleeper agent" is still an asset and can still play an active role in sedition, espionage or possibly treason[a] by virtue of agreeing to act if activated. 

Sleeper agents may also work in groups of a Clandestine cell system with other agents.

We know about the southern border but they do not tell you about our Ports and Airports are being flooded by Chinese, a lot of them young men that look of military training and grade.

Oklahoma city is filling up with them, they are everywhere. Bus loads full of them coming out of our airport. SOme shipped to other parts of Oklahoma even small towns.

Pay attention America we are being invaded by the Chinese and by our Government's doing.
