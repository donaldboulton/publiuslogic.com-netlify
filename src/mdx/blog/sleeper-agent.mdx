## Chinese and Mexican everybody else as Sleeper Agents

A sleeper agent, also called sleeper cell, is a spy who is placed in a target country or organization not to undertake an immediate mission but to act as a potential asset if activated. 

Even if un-activated, the "sleeper agent", is still an asset and can still play an active role in sedition, espionage or possibly treason[a] by virtue of agreeing to act if activated. 

Sleeper agents may also work in groups of a Clandestine cell system with other agents.

We know about the southern border but they do not tell you about our Ports and Airports are being flooded by Chinese, a lot of them young men that look of military training and grade.

Oklahoma city is filling up with them, they are everywhere. 

Bus loads full of them coming out of our airport. 

Some shipped to other parts of the USA all over Oklahoma even small towns.

Pay attention America we are being invaded by the Chinese through our Government's, both state and federal.

## Also A Nato Issue

The Chinese are invading your countries also in you airports and ports, pay attention before it's to late. 

Our Government's have sold us out, to Klaus Schwab, George Soros, Fouchi, The Hollywood Jews, and the Chinese! 

The Jews have destroyed the USA through our entertainment industry and money's to control our GOV, Tell them about it Ye.

They are going to freeze and starve us to capitulate, we will be straggling to survive, let alone having the ability to fight off a internal invasion that has already ocurred. 

And is sleeping, "But not for long"!

Money is more important to them than human life.

This should be extremely evident to all.
