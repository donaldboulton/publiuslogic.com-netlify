## Revelations 22 for 2022

[[danger]]
|> Verse 11 > Remember my Children, Let him who does wrong continue to do wrong; let him who is vile continue to be vile; let him who does right continue to do right; and let him who is holy continue to be holy."

> > Let him whom Professes Lies and Evil Continue to. "Profess Lies and Do Evil"!

## Purge Evil and Non Truth

<Callout>

<Center>All Is In A Trinity.</Center>

Positive-Neutral-Negative Yes-Maybe-No, Holy-Limbo-Evil, the trinity is represented in all things of substance and spirituality.

> You cannot have Good without Bad nor Love without Hate.
>
> > You have to embrace and find Love to know of being one with others bound together in your hearts and on a righteous path.
>
> > > You have to Know what you hate and act upon it, least it will destroy your love of self and others.

The Evil one's have taught you not to hate, except when and what they say to hate. You cannot hate the evil invaders next door that raped your daughter and killed your dog = Hate Crime.

But it's Ok to hate Russia as they are out to get you even though 90% of Americans have never talked with a Russian. So how could you hate them? You Never Met Them! Because someone else said to!

Your GOV and Evil thieves in the Church have destroyed your ability to differentiate between right and wrong. Destroying your God given, "Needed Ability's", to Discriminate and Hate.

> You cannot know true love with knowing passionate hate. But hate does not have to equated with killing, just forced separation.
>
> > Let your yes be Yes and Your no be No. As stuck between or maybe is being lost in limbo, and states you surely do not know your course.

</Callout>

The TIME HAS COME FOR WAR AMONGST MANKIND, Not so much against countries or are drawn between fictitious lines on the earth. A third of you are Holy, the Holy's job is to purge the third of the evil ones and capture the minds of the third Lost in limbo, as I capture there hearts!

Look across the table my children and what do your see? One's as the? Or are ye lost in there deceptions?

You see my Loves your World is based upon acceptance of lies, every play, Tv Show or Movie is made up, a portrayal, a lie, its not of truth, a deception to manipulate you away from the truths of the Trinity and your own heart's truths, killing within you your own path, "Your Truths", in life.

Your news, well who knows if even Fox News is 50% correct or 100% lies. You were not there, in any of the news stories, you were not in front of the camera or behind it; or in the news room editing department, "all deceptions", you simply were not there in any of the aspects of what they portray; "Or that You See".

Can you say 100% that you know any of this to be true, "You Cannot testify to God of its truths", so its all a lie, but you immerse yourselves in these non-truth's in every aspect of your lives.

| The Devil is trying to do everything She can do in my life to make the below lists of details on the evil one's, as tough on me as possible. I will overcome, may take a little help from OKC, haven't gotten much help from my own city and state, there to busy helping Invaders. Anything Below Holy Lost and Evil, "Next section", is UNFINISHED and just links to pages for now. Its not in my Heart to do this; but I must!
