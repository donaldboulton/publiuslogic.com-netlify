## Google Analytics

📈 The cookies in use to deliver Google Analytics service are described below.

Returning, New Session, Time, Custom Variable Data, Source

### Analytics Cookie Types

- \_\_utma

🤚 This cookie is used to determine new and returning visitors. It has an expiration time of 2 years. If the ga.js library is executed and no \_utma cookie exists, this will be recorded as the users’ first visit and a \_utma cookie will be set. If a \_utma cookie is already in place, the expiration time is reset and the user is recorded as a return visitor.

- \_\_utmb

🤚 This cookie is used to determine a new session. The cookie is set when the ga.js library executes and there is no \_utmb cookie in place. It has an expiration time of 30 minutes, therefore if a user is inactive for a period longer than this, a new cookie will be set when the library executes and the interaction will be recorded as a new session.

- \_\_utmz

🤚 This cookie is used to determine the traffic source, medium, campaign name and campaign term which delivered the user to your website. It is created when the javaScript library executes and expires after 6 months. This helps Google collect the data which can then help them to determine which traffic sources assist conversions within the multi-channel section of Analytics.

- \_\_utmc

🤚 This Cookie waits 30 minutes, and then it expires. You see, \_\_utmc has no way of knowing when a user closes their browser or leaves a website, so it waits 30 minutes for another pageview to happen, and if it doesn’t, it expires.
And is used to store information, such as what time your current visit occurred, whether you have been to the site before, and what site referred you to the web page.

From Stackoverflow: 🔗 [What does \_\_utma mean?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1823406/what-does-utma-mean)

- \_\_utmv

🤚 This cookie is used for storing visitor-level custom variable data. It is created when the \_setCustomVar method is used with a visitor level custom variable. Like the \_utma cookie, this cookie expires after 2 years and is reset each time the user visits your site before the expiration of the cookie.

Although each of these cookies has a set expiration time, each time the ga.js library is executed and the expiration time has not been met the cookie is updated, resetting the expiration date to its original value.

These cookies contain no personally identifiable information but they will use your computer's IP address to know from where in the world you are accessing the Internet.

Google stores the information collected by these cookies on servers in the United States. Google may transfer this information to third-parties where required to do so by law, or where such third-parties process the information on Google's behalf.

### Opt-out

😜 In order to provide website visitors with more choice on how data is collected by Google Analytics, Google has developed the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on. The add-on communicates with the Google Analytics JavaScript (ga.js) to stop data being sent to Google Analytics. The Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on does not affect usage of the website in any other way. A link to further information on the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on is provided below for your convenience.
