## Origin

Rob Landley posted [this](http://lists.landley.net/pipermail/toybox-landley.net/2013-March/004589.html) in the Toybox mailing list on 13 March 2013 to introduce the 0BSD licence which was subsequently adopted by the Toybox project.

> Reasoning: it was never my intent to require anybody to copy license text into another project if they cut and pasted something out of toybox. The "permission for any purpose" is as close to public domain as you can get in our current screwed up legal system without making people uncomfortable the _other_ way. (Besides, my initial reading of that was "all copies of the source code" but that's not what it says, and somebody pointed out that Android has "show license text" options because paranoid lawyers think that sort of thing applies to the BINARY version, which is nuts.)

> I'm not changing it this release, but in case anybody was going to object I thought I'd post it here for a bit first so I can remove your code if it really matters to you. This version is still outgoing-compatible with the old version (code that says the new thing can give code to a project that says the old thing, whether it could receive it depends on how paranoid your lawyers are).

In [Toybox](http://www.landley.net/toybox). It's also known as "Free Public License 1.0.0" and is similar to the [MIT No Attribution License](https://github.com/aws/mit-0).

It is an extremely permissive license, as it does not require the user to include the copyright notice, license text, or disclaimer in either source or binary forms.
