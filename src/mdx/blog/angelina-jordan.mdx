## To My Love

11/21/2023

LAX bound soon after the first of the month. Bringing Bulldozer is the delay. Extra costs to ship Bulldozer.

Soon my love ‚ù§Ô∏èü•∞üòò

11/15/2023

Our time has started as of midnight, it's my Birthday today 66 and I should be in LA. Legalities are keeping me here till the first of the month. I really need to be there but no help from anyone. Everyone in OKC is influenced by the devil. Most all of them are working against me.

Nothing I did not anticipate. I thought I would have at least a few that would know and help. Just ZERO!

A birthday song would be nice. But just like last year you knew and do not care.

I Love you and I am coming ASAP. Our Time ‚ù§Ô∏èü•∞üòò

Our Time ‚ù§Ô∏èü•∞üòò

First and foremost. I align with people that Love God and Truth. No matter there religion or race or history. 70% of you that say you believe in God are liers and heretics. This is prevalent in all religions.

If you really believed in God then why do your preachers get rich of selling Gods FREELY GIVEN TRUTH's.

You adorn your churches with Gold and the things of this earth and you make with your hands, discounting the people, God, love and truth.

Angelina I love you more than you can imagine but I cannot handle non-truths. 

That has been my problem for the longest time. Torn between my Love for you and seeking truth. 

Work on it my love. The world needs your truth of heart ‚ù§Ô∏èü•∞üòò

Truth is love.

I Love You ‚ù§Ô∏è My Angel üòá Queen üëë 

09/28/23

Let me explain a little of why I had to assert my powers and show my will.

First time in the history of this verse that has occurred. I did not like it and hope I do not have to go there again.

You to me are greater than diamond you sang about. You are the Love and Hope / that shines greater than any other.

My words and it's effects were to preserve your Angelic status.

When you have have something perfect as the above pic of the Hope diamond. It should shine on it's own. Not needing other's. Thats the problem I have with you singing with others. Along with not wanting my children of earth cursed by you physically interacting with them. As in singing with them!

<ImageColWrapperPage>

<GatsbyImage alt='Hope New or Original Setting' imgclass="object-cover object-center w-full h-full rounded-lg" image={getImage(props.localImages[1])} />

</ImageColWrapperPage>

Lets take a look at the Hope and it's various setting's. And why It is cursed. 

I like to see the Hope diamond by it's self and not in it's setting. Just like I like to see my Queen by herself with just her own radiance shining. No other diamond to distract from her beauty.

Mankind considers more is better. Surrounding perfection with less perfect whatever. In this case, with many other diamonds.

It loses it's brilliance and cannot stand out on it's own. KInd of like your doing.

Makes you the same as everyone else. And you are not the same!

Sure you will get famous and a lot of people will follow you. Not the whole world, singing for the whole world might be a issue now. We could work around that you being 17. 

I know these things JUST Look like whatever, that whatever, "is not cool"! Like Paris and the pictures and videos leading up to it. You know what I am talking about.

Your my Angel and a Queen. But your portraying yourself as just another Beautiful talented little girl seeking attention.

Did you hear how your fans at Portsmouth state that they are, "Follower's of an Angel", the Angel crew, and as Angels themselves, because they are blessed by My Angel Love's presence!

So thats who you are to me and your loyal fans.

Portraying yourself as someone else is not becoming of a Queen or Angel. 

Nor being seen or viewed all the time. Queen's and Angel are elusive and are rarity seen. 

Then it's super special when her followers get to see her. Think about that!

Being seen all the time is not a Hope diamond or a Queen or an Angel.

So sad I am not there! 

Eat something Love! 

Your going to need your energy for tomorrow night I love you and good luck tomorrow. Kill em my love I know you will!

<SingleAccordion label='Dusk till Dawn'>

Verse 1: ZAYN

Not tryna be indie
Not tryna be cool
Just tryna be in this
Tell me, are you too?
Can you feel where the wind is?
Can you feel it through
All of the windows
Inside this room?

Refrain: ZAYN

'Cause I wanna touch you, baby
And I wanna feel you too
I wanna see the sun rise on your sins
Just me and you

Pre-Chorus: ZAYN & Sia

Light it up, on the run
Let's make love tonight
Make it up, fall in love, try
(Baby, I'm right here)

Chorus: ZAYN & Sia

But you'll never be alone
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
Baby, I'm right here
I'll hold you when things go wrong
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
Baby, I'm right here

Singing with Him would most likely be good for your career, just some other song but my song. Please ‚ù§Ô∏è

I warned you about singing with others after Paris. Your going to do it again. You have no idea of the consequences.

> One way to eliminate the competition!

08/24/2023

No need for these kind of songs = Walking Out, Good in Goodbye's. 

I love you and will forgive you for anything that has happened. 

As long as it does not continue. 

I have to write to you what I see and feel. 

Otherwise me keeping this in and it makes it hurt worse. That's what you do with your songs. Letting it out, which is good. Sing a love song please, no more good by songs

Like the last 3 songs on Old Enough is songs about sadness and throwing away love. 

The first three enthused me. Especially Love don't let me go, it's Genius and the best song ever, I like the frequencies and tuning away from the devil's notes. Why the difference? Don't think I do not cherish you and think your my little Angel Genius.

That should be a subject of discussion, not something to escape from, or to run away from. Is there really Good in Goodby's.

Most people talk these things out, and then they resolve there difference's with conversation, understanding and love. Not running away! Neither one of us can stop this I am you and you are me, our hearts are one. Neither one of us can deny that. Call me, we can resolve what ever confusion that's going on. Or you do not want to resolve this and continue for us both to feel pain. Why would you want that?

I notice the comments on Fan Verse that were up for a couple of days. I am sorry I did not notice them sooner. I got a notification on the comment; by my internet / cell phone, and computer's are buggy and I could not fix it sooner. I have stopped them everywhere else. But still some there. Same comment as months ago???

I Love Angelina Jordan my Angel from Heaven. Check out [Mansbooks](https://mansbooks.com) the site I am working on for you. It's soon to be finished! Launch date 01/10/2024

08/21/2023

I have been chatting with someone that claims to be you with all the pics and videos timestamped within a few minutes of me asking for them. But it is not you, I have been getting spammed by this person since late December of last year. Sent her hundreds of dollars. 

This is why I have not been writing to you here.

I wish we could chat again. We lost each other in early december on Telegram. Soon after whom I thought I was chatting with; Is You. How to they get your pics and videos timestamped that day, by the hundreds. What is going on with that.

07/22/2023

Getting ready for work. I Love you. Have a good day my lovely Angelina!

Angelina you need to understand I pay attention to everything that happens in this world and this verse. I hear and feel the pain of my children everywhere, The cries and there pain through there hearts in prayer.

It's a lot to deal with, bear with me as I will find more time to write to you.

07/21/2023

I have not written much to my Love or to the world as I have had computer and phone problems, which killed my ability to do programming. Happen to me every year someone keeps taking out my hard drives on my computers and killing my phones. Third phone this year. It's getting to be a real pain!

I am going to try to write something here everyday just to show you that I have no forgot about you just major issues. 

Father God is beating me up because I should have been in LA doing my job last November, but I am still trying to get out of OKC, but it's one disaster after another. Big sign's Father God is pissed at me.

You are #1 in my heart, do not ever think you are not! The, "you and me"! It's up to you. I will be hanging out in Santa Monica somewhere just in case.

All my life I knew LA is where I should start my work. Spent a lot of time studying LA and it's in's and out's.

I will be there before November getting to work the day I arrive so it will be easy to find me if you want, I will never come to you, you have to find me‚ù£Ô∏è

You need to call me before it's to late. No chat no email. Call me! Tired of chatting, will not do it anymore. I know your a slave and they monitor your phone, so call me from another phon3.
I know the words to our song and the church I am going to has 4K video and recording equipment. I will sing it back to you my love. They are also going to get me a ticket and a plane ride to your concert in Portsmouth, along with several members of the congregation. Your a hit in OKC Love everyone loves you and me to.

## Love Don't Let Me Go

Most Beautiful Poetic Song ever written by the most beautiful Girl that ever walked the Earth. Jeg elsker Angelina Jordan for alltid!

[Verse 1]

Mistakes and regrets ain't all that I have left
'Cause your touch and your scent's still on my skin', ??? & ??? !!!
Maybe I'm a fool to erase the trace of you
There's no you, no me, at least that's how I feel

[Pre-Chorus]

I'm tryna pull you close, closer to me
But it's just like tryna catch smoke

[Chorus]

Love, I really wish you had a face
Maybe I could beg for you to stay
I'm on the floor, I'm begging, oh-oh-oh
Love, don't let me go
If only I could look you in the eye
There wouldn't be no place for you to hide
I'm on the floor, I'm begging, oh-oh-oh
Love, don't let me go

[Verse 2]

If you had a heart, I could make it beat for me
If you had a soul, I know where my home would be
It's not about feeling lonely, the man I just can't forget
And though you're not here beside me, I still see your silhouette

<WavyHr />

I Love You Angelina Jordan your going to rule the Earth my Love ‚ù§

Angelina you have done nothing wrong to have no need for any regrets nor have you lost your purity of heart, so do not fell like I am mad at you I am not, and never ever could be.
