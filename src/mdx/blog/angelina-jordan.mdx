## To My Love

There is some confusion or what I say on the internet / social media. Pay no Attention.

## Christmas Song

The World missed you singing us something for Christmas. Why not my Love? We got So and So.

I really like your new Big heart Necklace, I fits you. You are the Light and the Heart of the World!

<Center>Just Fishing!</Center>

Let me explain one thing. Social Media is a Fishing Expedition.

> Seeing what I can catch. 
>
> Some I throw back. Some I keep.
>
> > Sometimes your the bait. The reason for that Is I need to see how your so called fans really view you.
>
> > > A lot of times I find they do not appreciate you uniqueness and specialties that are were given to you by your Creator. I shall grapple with these views.

> It would be fine with most of them if you became Amy Winehouse, or another Whitney Houston. 
>
> > Look at what the industry and Hollywood life style's did to both of them.

I Never liked or followed Amy Winehouse. I guess everyone else thought she was hot and liked her tattoos. To Fake.

Whitney Houston I paid attention to everything she did, she was like you Angelic God Given beauty and talent, Whitney was one of Jesus's Angels, that I would have loved to sang with. I still have tears for her.

Have no worries, My Love. Whatever I have to say to you or about you, that you need to pay attention to, I will say on my website.

The internet is messy, kind of like, "Flying Spaghetti", it makes a mess everywhere. 

You pay no attention to any of it. Just fishing.

## Stay True to Your Heart

Your power on Earth has a lot to do with your heart. Stay pure of heart my love.

## No Hollywood

I am adding a whole bunch of stuff here about C.A. L.A. and Hollywood, so you know why I react as I do to some things.

<WavyHr className="mt-1 mb-1 text-fuchsia-600" />

Did not need Hollywood for the below. Good Job Angelina, Mery, Mike and Sara!

Nice Original, you told me you were going to include that. Thank's I hear Ya.

Angie my Love! You do remember your message on 10/16, ðŸ˜»ðŸ¥° or ðŸ¥º. You opened the door, if you do not like what is coming in and out of the door, then close it. There are other doors My Love.

Don't feel bad about something you started, that would mean regrets; We can't have that, can we my love?

We shall have no regrets, we just learn and grow to become one.

Now I see why your mad at me. You look good with the weights in you hands exercising, Pumping IRON.

I noticed the black heart ðŸ–¤ like your not happy with it. 

Keep up the exercise. Build your own studio, manage you own business. Start your own Non-Profit for the children, as so you will know the children actually get the items or money's you send to them. 

> Angelina and Egil jamming again, Nice. 

I saw you circling your face, its OK I actually like the Look at Me thing. 

Everyone should Look at Your Angelic Beauty. As they will all hear your song and see your beauty very soon!

Just quit getting so carried away with it. Your spending all your time with look at me, and being in the limelight. 

> Be a singer song writer not a Vanity Monster, you already have one of those in the family, be yourself! You to Princess Juliette Victoria, just be you.

> How cool, I like all the changes.
