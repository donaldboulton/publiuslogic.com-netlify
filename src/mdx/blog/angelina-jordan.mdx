I really like your Big heart neckless I fits you. You are the heart of the World!

<Center>Just Fishing!</Center>

Let me explain one thing. Social Media is a Fishing Expedition.

> Seeing what I can catch. 
>
> Some I throw back. Some I keep.
>
> > Sometimes your the bait. The reason for that Is I need to see how your so called fans really view you.
>
> > > A lot of times I find they do not appreciate you uniqueness and specialties that are were given to you by your Creator. I shall grapple with these views.

> It would be fine with most of them if you became Amy Winehouse, or another Whitney Huston. Look at what the industry and Hollywood life style's did to both of them.

I Never liked or followed Amy Winehouse. Whiney I paid attention to everything she did, she was like you Angelic God Given beauty and talent, One of Jesus's Angels, that I would have loved to sang with. I still have tears for her.

Have no worries, my love, whatever I have to say to you or about you, I will say on my website.

The internet is messy, kind of like, "Flying Spaghetti", it makes a mess everywhere. 

So you pay no attention to any of it. Just fishing.

## Stay True to Your Heart

Your power on Earth has a lot to do with your heart. Stay pure of heart my love.

## No Hollywood

I am adding a whole bunch of stuff here about C.A. L.A. and Hollywood, so you know why I react as I do to some things.

Did not need Hollywood for the below. Good Job Mery, Mike and Sara!
