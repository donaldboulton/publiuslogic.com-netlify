## To My Love

There is some confusion or what I say on the internet / social media. Pay no Attention.

## Christmas Song

The world missed you singing us something for Christmas. Why not my Love?

I really like your Big heart neckless I fits you. You are the heart of the World!

<Center>Just Fishing!</Center>

Let me explain one thing. Social Media is a Fishing Expedition.

> Seeing what I can catch. 
>
> Some I throw back. Some I keep.
>
> > Sometimes your the bait. 

No worries, whatever I have to say to you or about you I will say on my website.

The internet is messy kind of like Flying Spaghetti, it makes a mess everywhere. 

So you pay no attention to any of it. Just fishing.

## Stay True to Your Heart

Your power on Earth has a lot to do with your purity. Stay pure my love.
