I Love the new song and it tells me you really do love me.

You have done nothing wrong to have any regrets nor have you lost your purity of heart, so do not fell like I am mad at you I am not and never ever could be. I am pissed at your family all of them, Except for you Sissy, your the one with the brain cells of the family, I see it in your eyes. You would be the perfect manager for when me and my love start our work on earth, showing Angie's love to the world. Like your mom and your sister, Juliette your one of the most beautiful beings on this planet. When you were crying when Mery was having surgery an the video of your profile and the tears running down your face I saw the most passionate and beautiful profile ever, I mean ever. Wow. My trinity of Angel mich just be you three. Even though I am kind of pissed a Sara for taking my Love to see evil

When you fist announced it on the 3rd you said I wrote this song for you. I wish you would have said I wrote this song for Don. And I was still not sure it was to me. I put what I felt at the time here and did not really think you paid attention to what I write. But the next day you had read this and said on the 5th "should I really release this song", because I pissed you off with what I said. My stats said only 22 people viewed what I said in the 5 days it was up. 18 of them were from Russia and China, so no one saw what I said but you and a few others.

Let me explain something to you. I recognized when you were 8 years old how much your energy force affects other and knew then you were my Love, my special Angel that father God gave to me and the one I have cherished through out creation and the times of this verse.

I found that our hearts were connected and when you were happy I knew it and when you are sad, I was sad.

Everything was all good then on stage AGT you said what you said to Simon and it got me going to where I did not pay much attention to you till Million Milles. I had felt your heart break when your grandfather died and it broke my heart also. At that point I started paying attention to every detail of what you would show us. What was in the background of where you were at what you wore your shoes everything.

And have had since. I noticed when you experienced things I felt them also. Sometime between Million MIles and 7th heaven your heart broke again and I am still not for sure what that was. I sensed it had something to do with Republic Records and Rob Christy. On your birthday I noticed your reaction at republic records toward Rob and that he was super uptight about you being around him. Then lots that you had shown me in videos became clear to what was going on mostly your lip sinking certain words. I will leave it at that. Thats for just you and me to discuss later.

But the whole time between 7th heaven and 1/10/23. I was at a loss of what was going on in your heart. It was messing me up.

Because our hearts are one when you see immorality hate or evil it affects me. Not just my heart and mind but physically, makes me sick and is destroying me with what you participate in.

Sara you are not evil you look out for my angel. I did not like the after party of the emmy awards, that was your choice and that's on you, not Angelina. To you that was just entertainment to me it was straight up evil. Please quit showing my Angel bad things. She projects that around the world and it hurts all of us. She can project Love or hate , Good or Evil so she needs to stay away from hate, violence and worshiping the Devil.

I do love you more than you can imagine! No matter how much hate and torture you put me through. Maybe it's a test and your just playing me. I do not know, first time in my life, I am just lost. I have not written anything since last year. I had to force myself to write this. You really have me fucked up and I think you like it.

I will Love Angelina Jordan Forever. üíï ‚ù§Ô∏è
