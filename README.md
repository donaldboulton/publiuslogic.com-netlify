## How to use the starter

1. Clone your own version of the starter template or fork the repository. Run `yarn` then `yarn build` or `yarn develop`.
2. The default colour scheme is purple to match the Gatsby logo. Change to your preferred hue by doing a global search and replace of '-gray-' to your favourite colour.
3. The home (landing) page consists of a number of components (Hero, Feature, CTA, ...) - edit these components in `src/components` to customise.
4. The `/contact` page displays an OpenStreetMaps map via Leaflet - customise by changing to your preferred set of coordinates.
5. `gatsby-config.js` has all the site parameters - edit site metadata to suit.
6. Create new MDX pages in `src/mdx` (using either `.md` or `.mdx` extension). Add React components to MDX in the `src/pages/{mdx.slug}.tsx` file.
7. Any content created in the `src/mdx/blog` subdirectory will automatically be a blog post. Use `src/mdx/blog/2000-01-01-template.md` as a base for creating a new blog post.
8. If you create a new tag (eg. `newtag`) a new tag page will be created ie. `/tags/newtag`. The `/tags` page will enumerate all tags.
9. If you want to change the navigation menu, edit `src/components/header.tsx`. Similarly, edit `src/components/footer.tsx` to customise the footer.
10. If you make a lot of changes, use `yarn lint` and `yarn type-check` to check everything is okay.

## SendGrid configuration (for contact form)

Insert the following environment variables (either in .env or on deployment host):

- `SENDGRID_API_KEY`
- `SENDGRID_AUTHORIZED_EMAIL`

## Just Having Fun

üç∏ This website is built as static HTML with Gatsby component-modular Docker Container builds using React components and GraphQL, Built with WebPack. Including a user data backend on FaunaDB.

Served on Netlify via a continuous deployment (CD) workflow. Pull requests are automatically built into preview apps, while commits to the master branch trigger the production build and deploy onto Netlify‚Äôs CDN edge node infrastructure. Since the whole site is just a bunch of static files copied onto multiple CDN nodes around the world, time to first byte (TTFB) is consistently fast at around 1ms to 2ms. Instant Notifications through my Slack Bots or GMail and phone notifications using Netlify Functions for my Mansbooks.com publiuslogic.com workspace.

## Gatsby Starter Publius

üöÄ This repo powers the Gatsby site hosted at publiuslogic.com. I use it to write about my personal interests, ranging from theoretical physics and spiritual learning to sustainability, web development and spending time outdoors... oh and not to forget breaking conventions like a Gatsby Site with Json-Ld per template for SEO, Internet Positioning.

Feel free to reuse any part of this repo to create your own Gatsby site.

A [Gatsby v4](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) üó∏ and [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org) üó∏ powered generic business website starter based on [gatsby-starter-netlify-cms](https://github.com/AustinGreen/gatsby-starter-netlify-cms) üó∏

### Server-less

üî• No run time dependency or vulnerable server stack required Pre-built pages served over a CDN for fastest time to first byte Fast and cheap CDN scaling results in ultra-high availability worldwide Server-side processes abstracted into microservice APIs for reduced attack surface areas Modern Continuous Deployment (CD) Git workflows with instant rollbacks Headless CMS for complete separation from your app/site and with full version control Modern authentication methods such as OAuth 2 for ultimate security.

#### What is Netlify Identity

‚ÅâÔ∏è Netlify‚Äôs Identity service is a plug-and-play microservice for handling site
functionalities like signups, logins, password recovery, user metadata, and
roles. You can use it from single page apps instead of rolling your own, and
integrate with any service that understands JSON Web Tokens (JWTs).

Learn more about this service from this
[Blog Post](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2017/09/07/introducing-built-in-identity-service-to-streamline-user-management/) üó∏

It follows the [JAMstack architecture](https://jamstack.org) üó∏ by using Git as a single source of truth, and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) üó∏ for continuous deployment, and CDN distribution.

## Netlify CMS

[Static + content management = ‚ù§Ô∏è](https://www.netlifycms.org/) üó∏

üñ•Ô∏è Netlify CMS is Always the latest Netlify CMS GitHub repo pull, with my custom Webpack hashed build, not the Gatsby plugin and netlify-cms node module way; which builds it into the frontend = slowing Gatsby way down; TEST it to see for yourself.

My custom dark build of the Netlify Identity Widget is used on the Gatsby frontend and in my git-gateway back-end.

Get the speed, security, and scalability of a static site, while still providing a convenient editing interface for content.

An integrated part of your Git workflow
Content is stored in your Git repository along side your code for easier versioning, multi-channel publishing, and the option to handle content updates directly in Git.

### An extensible CMS built on React

‚ù§Ô∏è Netlify CMS is built as a single-page React app. Create custom-styled previews, UI widgets, and editor plugins or add backends to support different Git platform APIs.
My Netlify CMS backend will build and add Pages, Posts, My layout components with Event data for Bulma GCal fullCalendar localized events, Notifications, Authors, Products, Site Updates and charts data using charts.js displaying build, sales and analytics charts data on individual pages and posts. All edited from a CMS Backend on a Static Website!
